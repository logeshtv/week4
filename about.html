    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Poetry Collection is dedicated to making classic poetry accessible to everyone. We believe that poetry deserves to be discovered, read, and shared by all. Through our simple yet elegant interface, we connect readers with the timeless works of literary masters.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Our website uses the <strong>PoetryDB API</strong>, a comprehensive public database of classic poetry. This allows us to provide you with instant access to thousands of poems across multiple genres and time periods. The interface is designed to be intuitive and distraction-free, letting the poetry shine.</p>
